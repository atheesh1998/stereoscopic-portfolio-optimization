# Stereoscopic Portfolio Optimization

~ Inspired by the work of Lamarcus Coleman

The framework introduces the idea of bottom up optimization via the use of machine learning ensembles applied to certain market microstructure components, along with the top-down approach of the Efficient Frontier model, to create a stereoscopic model.

The usage of ensemble models is heavily emphasised, since their goal is to minimize the cost function. This is analogous to the goal of portfolio optimization - minimize risk.
